# Java First Assignment

Welcome to your first Java assignment! In this assignment, you will be implementing a simple method to add two integers using a Gradle project structure.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src/main/java` directory.
3. Open the `SumCalculator.java` file located in the `src/main/java` directory.
4. Implement the `add` method in the `SumCalculator` class. This method should take two integers as parameters and return their sum.

### Running the Program

To run the program, you will need to execute the `main` method in the `SumCalculator` class. Here is how you can do it using Gradle:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
2. Run the following command to execute the `main` method:

```grade run```

### Testing the Program

Testing your solution is crucial to ensure its correctness. You can test your solution locally using the following steps:

1. Navigate to the `src/test/java` directory and open the `SumCalculatorTest.java` file to view or add test cases.
2. To run the tests, open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Execute the following command to run the tests:

```gradle test```

## Grading

Your assignment will be graded automatically based on the correctness of your implementation. The grading script will use the tests defined in the `SumCalculatorTest` class to assess the correctness of your solution.

Make sure to test your solution thoroughly before submitting by using the provided unit tests. You can add additional tests in the `SumCalculatorTest` class if necessary.

Good luck!
